Screen Sharing Sample App
=========================

This project shows how to use OpenTok iOS SDK to publish a stream that shares the entire screen 
We use Apple ReplayKit to capture the entire screen contents and stream using Customer capturer.

For simplicity, we load a Webkit view and load a URL. Then we start capturing the screen and publish to the session.

In ViewController.swift, please add your own Apikey, Session ID and Token.
